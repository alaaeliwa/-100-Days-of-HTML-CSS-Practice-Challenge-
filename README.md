🌟 100 Days of HTML & CSS Practice Challenge 🧠💻

Hi, I’m Alaa — and this is my personal journey through 100 days of HTML & CSS.
I created this challenge for myself to move beyond tutorials and start building with my own hands. One project a day, no excuses. Just me, the code, and a dream to grow. 💻❤️

📁 What You'll Find Here:
    A folder for each of the 100 days
    Each folder contains a simple project I built from scratch
    Some are small, some are messy — but each one taught me something
